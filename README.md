# creatures

An HTML/CSS/JS example working with data attributes

Background: In this extra credit opportunity, you'll work with the JavaScript data attributes to identify a collection of divs that store icons representing various creatures that are identified by type (animal, insect) and home, meaning their natural environment (land, water air). 

Using this data, we'll use buttons on a page to trigger JS functions that will change background colors & border colors & styles to demonstrate how to access nodelists of elements on a page, that operate as an array in JavaScript.
